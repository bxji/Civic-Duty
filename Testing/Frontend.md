# Front End Unit Testing

React Native uses a form of JavaScript unit testing in order to test for bugs and errors. Here is where we tested our front end using React Native's build in unit testing command.

## How To Run

To run the unit test, please open up your terminal, navigate to the `cmps115_final` folder, and run the following terminal command: `npm test`.

## How To Read the Results

Once you run the terminal command `npm test` in the project folder, you will get a detailed report about the test suite. For our project, the test suite fails, but only due to an imported package that we need for pulling the user's zip code.
