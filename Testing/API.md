# All API's

### All backend functions can be tested through Django's UnitTests module.

### To do so, navigate to the CMPS115 folder, then type in the following command
"python manage.py test"

Doing so will run all unit tests, which are located in CMPS115/civicduty/tests.py

Alternatively, you can choose to run unit tests for a specific API by typing in

"python manage.py test <API Name>TestCases" 

which will run test cases specifically for that API.
