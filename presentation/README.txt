version 2 is the complete version of slide. 
version 3 is similar but has slides that are slightly modified. 
Some of the UIs are better,  but not consistant with other UIs

WARNING: Opening the slide through google drive (google presentation) will
result in font decomposition. This is similar to opening MS Word on google
drive and losing symbols/fonts.
